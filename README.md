### This repo includes a Release
- the release contains a 200MB and 96MB loan data csv, and
- a 340MB loan csv **ZIP** file. The zip extarcts into a 1.2 GB loan.csv file

The purpose of the inclusion is such that this repository contains both the code and data to do a meaningful replication of what is seen. Often repositories for data analysis do not contain the data use,d nor links ot that data. Moreover, the links many not point to live resources. Finally, the amount of data included, tends ot be too small, and thus devoid of deficiencies, sizable stratifications, etc.

While the loan.cav.zip is merely a reuploaded resource from Kaggle, yu don't have to go to Kaggle search for the exact 1.16 GB, 145 column, 2 260 668 row file.

Enjoy
